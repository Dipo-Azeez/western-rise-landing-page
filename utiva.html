     <p>This is a paragraph. i can use this to describe many things.so that's all.</p>
     <p>This is yet another paragraph.call this paragraph 2 </p>
     <p>this is paragraph 3.<br />This paragraph is used to test the breaking tag.i hope it works.I can draw a line like this: <hr /></p>
     <p>i can try to apply some knowledge of microsoft here as well. For example, <b>this element is boldened</b>.<i>I can do this as well by italising an element. <u>I can also try to underline this element.<b><i><u> But i think i can also combine bold,italics and underline on this element</u></i></b></u></i></p>
